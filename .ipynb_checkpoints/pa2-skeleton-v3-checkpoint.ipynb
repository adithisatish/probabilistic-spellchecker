    "In this assignment, we will build a probabilistic spelling corrector to automatically correct errors in queries. More formally, given a (possibly corrupt) raw query $R$, our goal is to find the intended query $Q$ which maximizes the probability $P(Q\\mid R)$. That is, we want to guess the query which the user probably meant to submit. By Bayes' Theorem we have\n",

    "    P(Q\\mid R) = \\frac{P(R\\mid Q)P(Q)}{P(R)}\\propto P(R\\mid Q)P(Q).\n",

    "Since our goal is to find the value of $Q$ which maximizes $P(Q\\mid R)$, this shows it is sufficient to maximize $P(R\\mid Q)P(Q)$. With the above formulation in mind, we will build a probabilistic spelling corrector consisting of 4 parts:\n",
    "  1. **Language Model.**\n",
    "      Estimates the prior distribution of unigrams and bigrams, allowing us to estimate $P(Q)$. We will use maximum-likelihood estimation, which counts the occurrences of token unigrams and bigrams in the training corpus in order to determine their prior probabilities.\n",
    "  2. **Edit Probability Model.**\n",
    "      Estimates the likelihood of errors that may occur in a query, which allows us to estimate $P(R\\mid Q)$. In particular, this component estimates the probability of characters being mistakenly deleted, inserted, substituted, or transposed in a query term.\n",
    "  3. **Candidate Generator.**\n",
    "      Takes a raw query $R$ submitted by the user, and generates candidates for $Q$.\n",
    "  4. **Candidate Scorer.**\n",
    "      Combines (1), (2), and (3) to compute $Q^{*} = \\arg\\max_{Q}P(Q\\mid R)$. That is, for each $Q$ generated by the candidate generator, the scorer uses the language model to estimate $P(Q)$ and uses the edit probability model to estimate $P(R\\mid Q)$, and finally chooses $Q$ which maximizes $P(Q)P(R\\mid Q)$."

    "\n",
    "The assignment is due at **4:00 PM PST on Tuesday, May 7th, 2019**. We have split the assignment up into the following parts:\n",
    "  1. [Task 1: Spelling Correction with Uniform Edit Costs](#uniform): **55%** of your total grade for this assignment depends on a correctly implemented solution for task 1. Your solution will be evaluated on a hidden test set, and full credit will be given to models that are within 1% of the staff implementation's test-set accuracy or higher. We do not publish the test set queries or our accuracy on the test set. However, as a guideline for performance, the staff implementation with uniform edit probability model gets **82.42% on the dev set.** We will give partial credit on a non-linear scale (which disproportionately favors models that are closer to our threshold for full credit, as an encouragement to squeeze out more performance improvements).\n",
    "  2. [Task 2: Spelling Correction with Empirical Edit Costs](#empirical): **25%** of your total grade is based on your implementation of task 2. Full credit will be granted for accuracy levels within 1% of the staff implementation's test-set accuracy or higher. Again, we do not publish our test set accuracy, but the staff implementation with empirical edit probability model gets **87.91% on the dev set.** As with Task 1, we will give partial for lower accuracy levels, we will give partial credit on a non-linear scale, with credit accruing more rapidly as your solution gets closer to the target.\n",
    "  3. [Written Report](#written): **20%** of your grade is based on the 1-2 page report that you will submit through Gradescope. See [Section VI](#written) for instructions and grading breakdown.\n",
    "  4. [Extra Credit (Optional)](#extra): **Up to 10%** extra credit will be awarded for implementing extensions, with an explanation in the report. It is not necessary for the extensions to radically improve accuracy to get credit. As described in [Section VII](#extra), you can also get a small amount of extra credit if your system is a top performer in terms of accuracy or running time.\n",
    "\n",
    "The submission procedure is the same as in PA1, but we repeat the instructions here for your reference:\n",
    "  - This assignment should be done in teams of two or individually. Assignments are graded the same for one and two person teams.\n",
    "  - The notebook will automatically generate Python files in `submission` folder. To submit your assignment, **upload the Python files to the PA2-code assignment on Gradescope.** Note that you need to upload all the individual files in the `submission` folder without zipping it.\n",
    "  - While solving the assignment, do **NOT** change class and method names, otherwise the autograder tests will fail.\n",
    "  - You'll also have to **upload a PDF version of the notebook (which would be primarily used to grade your report section of the notebook) to PA2-PDF assignment on Gradescope.** Note that directly converting the PDF truncates code cells. To get a usable PDF version, first click on `File > Print Preview`, which will open in a new tab, then print to PDF using your browser's print functionality.\n",
    "  - After uploading the PDF make sure you tag all the relevant pages to each question. We reserve the right to penalize for mistagged submissions.\n",
    "  - If you are solving the assignment in a team of two, add the other student as a group member after submitting the assignment. Do **NOT** submit the same assignment twice."

    "Many of the probabilities we will encounter in this assignment are very small. When we multiply many small numbers together, there is a risk of [underﬂow](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arithmetic_underflow). Therefore, it is common practice to perform this type of probability calculation in log space. Recall that:\n",
    "  1. The log function is monotonically increasing, therefore $\\arg\\max p = \\arg\\max\\log p$.\n",
    "  2. We have $\\log(pq) = \\log p + \\log q$, and by extension $\\log\\left(\\prod_{i} p_i\\right) = \\sum_{i}\\log p_i$.\n",
    "\n",
    "As a result, if we want to maximize $P(\\textbf{x}) = P(x_1)P(x_2)\\cdots P(x_n)$, we can equivalently maximize $\\log P(\\textbf{x}) = \\log P(x_1) + \\log P(x_2) + \\cdots + \\log P(x_n)$. **For numerical stability, we recommend that you use this log-space formulation throughout the assignment.**"

The two queries are tab-separated in the file `pa2-data/training_set/edit1s.txt`. You will use this data to build a probability model for the \"noisy channel\" of spelling errors.\n",
    "  - **Query Dev Set (`pa2-data/dev_set`).** 455 pairs of misspelled and corrected queries, which you will use to measure the performance of your model.  There are three files in `pa2-data/dev_set/`: the (possibly) misspelled queries are in `queries.txt`, corrected versions are in `gold.txt`, and Google's suggested spelling corrections are in `google.txt`.\n",

    "\n",
    "As a first pass, we will implement a *uniform-cost edit model.* This model simplifies the computation of the edit probability by assuming that every individual edit in the Damerau-Levenshtein distance has the same probability. You should try a range of values for your uniform edit probability, but in the beginning 0.01 - 0.10 is appropriate. One important thing to remember in building your model is that the user's input query $R$ may indeed be the right one in a majority of cases (*i.e.,* $R = Q$). Thus we typically choose a high ﬁxed probability for `edited == original`; a reasonable range is 0.90 - 0.95.\n",
    "\n",
    "The edit probability model that you construct here will be used when you rank candidates for query corrections. The candidate generator (described in the next section) will make one edit at a time, and it will call the edit probability model each time it makes a single edit to a term, summing log-probabilities for multi-edit changes. Therefore, all you need to do in this part is to calculate the probability of `edited` given that it is **at most one edit from `original`.** This means that `get_edit_logp` will be very simple in this case.\n",

    "### IV.3. Candidate Generator\n",
    "\n",
    "Recall that the candidate generator takes a raw query $R$ submitted by the user, and generates candidates for the intended query $Q$. Since we know that more than 97% of spelling errors are found within an edit distance of 2 from the user's intended query, we encourage you to consider possible query corrections that are within distance 2 of $R$. This is the approach taken by Peter Norvig in [his essay on spelling correction](http://norvig.com/spell-correct.html). However, it is not tractable to use a pure \"brute force\" generator that produces all possible strings within distance 2 of $R$, because for any $R$ of non-trivial length, the number of candidates would be enormous. Thus we would have to evaluate the language and edit probability models on a huge number of candidates.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### IV.3.1. Candidate Generator with Restricted Search Space\n",
    "\n",
    "We can make the naïve approach tractable by aggressively narrowing down the search space while generating candidates. There are many valid approaches to efficient candidate generation, but here are a few basic ideas:\n",
    "  - Begin by looking at *each individual term* in the query string $R$, and consider all possible edits that are distance 1 from that term.\n",
    "  - Remember that you might consider hyphens and/or spaces as elements of your character set. This will allow you to consider some relatively common errors, like when a space is accidentally inserted in a word, or two terms in the query were mistakenly separated by a space when they should actually be joined.\n",
    "  - Each time you generate an edit to a term, make sure that the edited term appears in the dictionary. (Remember that we have assumed that all words in a valid candidate query will be found in our training corpus, as mentioned above in [Section IV.1.2](#smoothing) above).\n",
    "  - If you have generated possible edits to multiple individual terms, take the Cartesian product over these terms to produce a complete candidate query that includes edits to multiple terms. (But remember that you probably shouldn't go beyond a total edit distance of 2 for the query overall).\n",
    "  \n",
    "Again, there are many possible extensions and variations on the strategies mentioned here. We encourage you to explore some diﬀerent options, and then describe in your written report the strategies that you ultimately used, and how you optimized their performance. Note that **solutions that exhaustively generate and score all possible query candidates at edit distances 1 and 2 will run too slowly and will not receive full credit.**"

    "\n",
    "As outlined in [Section III](#dataset) above, you have been given a list of query pairs that are precisely edit distance 1 from each other. The ﬁrst step for this task is to devise a simple algorithm to determine which speciﬁc edit exists between the two queries in each pair. By aggregating the counts of all such edits over all queries, you can estimate the probability of each individual edit. The edit probability calculation is described in more detail in the [lecture handout on spelling correction](http://web.stanford.edu/class/cs276/handouts/spell_correction.pdf). As an example, if you need to determine the probability of the letter 'e' being (mistakenly) replaced by the letter 'a' in a query, you should calculate:\n",
    "$$\n",
    "    P(\\texttt{sub}[a, e]) = \\frac{\\texttt{count}(\\texttt{sub}[a, e])}{\\texttt{count}(e)}.\n",
    "$$\n",
    "Note that the insertion and deletion operator probabilities are conditioned on the character before the character being operated on &mdash; which also means that you should devise an appropriate solution to handle the special case of insertions or deletions occurring at the beginning of a word. Finally, to account for the inevitable problem of data sparsity in our edit training ﬁle, you should apply Laplace add-one smoothing to the edit probabilities, as described in the lecture handout (linked above)."

    "We have listed a few ideas here, but really any extensions that go above and beyond the scope of tasks 1 and 2 will be considered.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Expanded edit model.** We saw (or will see) in lecture that there are sometimes spelling errors that may not be within a \"naive\" edit distance 2 of the correct phrase, but that may have a conceptual basis that makes them very common and understandable. (Substituting 'ph' for 'f', or vice versa, is one such example.) Can you incorporate these types of errors into the edit probabilities of your edit probability model?\n",
    "2. **Empirical edit costs using Wikipedia.** In task 2, you used the dataset of queries 1 edit distance apart to learn edit probabilities. If you look at the queries in this dataset, you will observe that most of these queries are related to the Stanford corpus, the same corpus used to build the language model. It would be interesting to explore what happens if the channel model and language model are learned from diﬀerent datasets (and hence diﬀerent distributions of the underlying data). To this end, you can use a dataset of spelling errors collected from Wikipedia and available on Peter Norvig’s website (http://norvig.com/ngrams/spell-errors.txt).\n",
    "3. **Alternate Smoothing.** Try other smoothing algorithms (such as Kneser-Ney smoothing) to better capture probabilities in the training corpus.\n",
    "4. **K-gram index.** To deal with unseen words, it is possible to develop a measure for the probability of that word being spelled correctly by developing a character k-gram index over your corpus. For example, a q not followed by a u should lead to a low probability. This index can also help you generate candidate corrections much more eﬃciently.\n",
    "5. **Levenshtein Automata.** You can do even faster candidate generation using a Levenshtein transducer (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Levenshtein_transducer), which uses a ﬁnite state automata for fuzzy matching of words. There is an experimental implementation in Python at https://gist.github.com/491973, but it needs to be generalized to perform the transposition operation too. This tutorial might be helpful: http://blog.notdot.net/2010/07/Damn-Cool-Algorithms-Levenshtein-Automata.\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, we will give a small amount of extra credit to the best spell correction systems, measured in terms of both accuracy and running time (as computed on our hidden test data). The top 5 systems according to either metric will receive 5% each, while the next 15 systems will receive 2.5% each.\n",
    "\n",
    "**If you decide to tackle an extra credit option, give a brief description of your approach and results below.**"
