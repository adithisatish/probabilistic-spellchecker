# Automatic Spelling Correction Using Probabilistic Methods

In this project, we implement two probabilistic methods of automatic spelling correction, inspired by Peter Norvig's algorithm.
The algorithms implemented are Uniform Edit Cost and Empirical Edit Cost. We compare both these algorithms to Google's spell checker on a test set of 455 queries. 

Both our algorihms obtain an accuracy of 87.25% on the test set, as compared to Google's 83.08%.

### Quick Start
Run the following commands from the root directory of the cloned respository:
  1. `conda env create -f environment.yml`
  2. `conda activate cs276-pa2` (or `source activate cs276-pa2`)
  3. `jupyter notebook`

This opens up the Jupyter Notebook file in the web broswer.
